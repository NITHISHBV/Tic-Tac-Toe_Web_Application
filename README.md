Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Project Description:

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple, interactive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game allows users to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game against either another player or a computer opponent. Itâ€™s a fun and engaging project designed to showcase my ability to implement game logic and user interactions in a web environment.

Features:
Two-Player Mode:
Users can play the game in a two-player mode, where players take turns marking X and O in the 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the game results in a tie.

Computer Mode (Optional):
In addition to the two-player mode, users can also play against the computer, where the computer makes random moves, providing an additional challenge for single-player gameplay.

Game Reset:
After each game, users can easily reset the board to start a new round without needing to refresh the page. This is made possible by the use of JavaScript to dynamically reset the game state.

Win Condition Detection:
The game checks for three-in-a-row conditions both horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. When a player wins, the game displays a victory message, and the game board is reset for a new game.

Responsive Design:
The game is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes to ensure a smooth experience on mobile devices as well as desktops.

User-Friendly Interface:
The interface is clean and simple, making it easy for users to interact with the game. The board consists of clickable cells where players place their marks (X or O), and it visually indicates the winner or a tie.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Used for structuring the game board, buttons, and layout of the game page.

CSS: Responsible for styling the game, including the grid, buttons, and overall visual appearance to make the game both visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript: Handles the game logic, including player turns, win detection, game reset, and interactions between the game elements. It also ensures that the game state is properly managed throughout the gameplay.
